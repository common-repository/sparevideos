== How to == 

* Install and activate the plugin after you open an account with SpareVideos.com Copy and fill in the settings page of the plugin with the API credentials

* Start uploading and embedding videos from your Media Manager and give access to specific roles to also use the plugin

* Instead of embedding in posts and pages you can also use the "Make Video Page" button to set the video in the meta tags of the page/post.

* Then use the following code anywhere in the template to show the player with the video you selected to Make Video Page:

‘<?php echo do_shortcode('[sparevideos]'); ?>’

== About "Make Video Page" ==

By selecting a video (uploaded in THAT specific post/page) you have an extra option/button, that of "Make Video Page", which puts the selected video in the meta tags of the post/page. The filter which converts shortcodes in text into javascript code (embedding video player in other words) doesn't work for the video saved in meta tags. What embeds the video player into the selected position in the template instead, is the php code here above mentioned. That code fetched the video sved in metas and converts it to embedded player in that position.

An all-in-one solution for video management. SpareVideos provides the technology to host, convert and stream videos on demand. We offer UIs to upload and manage videos from inside our website, an API for those who want to build their websites or apps on top of our software and the WP plugin that actually uses the API to let WP admins and users do the same things effortlessly through their familiar WordPress control panel, through the Component's left menu and through the "Add Media" button above the text editor.
